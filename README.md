# Object Store Gateway Contract Attributes

This library includes helper functions for appending event attributes in a [CosmWasm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm)-based
smart contract.

This is to be used in tandem with the [event-stream](https://github.com/FigureTechnologies/event-stream)-watching
capabilities of [Object Store Gateway](https://github.com/FigureTechnologies/event-stream).
